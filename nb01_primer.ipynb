The beauty of Jupyter Notebooks, however, is that it allows you to combine **computer code**, **mathematical equations in LaTeX**, and regular prose (words) in **Markdown** all in one interactive document. Colab notebooks are great because it provides the benefits of Jupyter notebooks without requiring students to install software on their own computers; rather, all of the code you run will be done in the Google Cloud. This means we don't have to worry about pesky installation issues, and everyone is on a level playing field. The same code will, in theory, run at the same speed whether you execute it from your phone or from a supercomputer. \n","\n","Jupyter notebooks in Python have the largest market share, but you can also run them using the R or Julia coding languages. For our class, we will use Jupyter notebooks in R. All three languages are in widespread use in Applied Statistics and Data Science. Note that R Jupyter notebooks aren't *officially* supported by Google Colab, but we can make them work. \n","\n","One big reason that Jupyter notebooks are used so widely in applied sciences is that they make it easy to develop mathematical models and software implementing these models, and *include explanations and derivations right in the same file*. This, along with the fact that you can export the notebook to a PDF (or other document formats), facilitates the sharing of research work. Being able to do this remotely is important (especially in the current pandemic situation), and being able to work with a lab partner (or *Colab* partner, if you will?! You won't? That's okay, I laughed) is just plain nice. It would be annoying to have to send codes to one another iteratively to work on something... and so enter Colab Jupyter notebooks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5DcDLCzGcjTN","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<br>\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1  Accessing and opening the Jupyter Notebook file\n","\n","**a)** To access Colab notebooks, go to https://colab.research.google.com/. \n","\n","**b)** From there, we can access the Jupyter notebook that I created this PDF tutorial from by pasting in the Github link. If you are unfamiliar with Github, just think of it as a big archive of different repositories of software. Each user can have their own set of repositories, and each repository is typically dedicated to a particular purpose. I set up a repository to house the Jupyter notebooks for this class. It's a great purpose.\n","\n","In the upper-left of your screen, you should see the `File` menu. Click it, and then click `Open notebook`.\n","\n","Click on the `Github` option on the horizontal menu along the top of the page that opens.\n","\n","Paste the Github URL for the `primer_r.ipynb` file on the search line next to the magnifying glass.

You should get an error message that says \"Cannot save changes. You do not have permission to save this notebook. To keep your changes, make a copy of the notebook.\" This message is telling you that I, the author of the notebook, don't want you messing around with my notebook! Fair enough. So, you need to click `Save a copy in Drive`. This will save a copy of the notebook in _your own_ Google Drive. Go ahead and click that now. Alternatively, you could have clicked `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` straightaway without that `Ctrl+S` nonsense.\n","\n","This will open a new window with a file entitled `Copy of primer_r.ipynb`. You can see this title at the top of your screen. This is _your version_ of the file, saved in *your* Google Drive as opposed to my Google Drive (where I made the file) or my Github repository (where I shared the file with you). Thus, we call your new version of the file your *local* version (since it is local to you). But, I'm sorry to say, the file's title sucks. Let's fix that. Click anywhere on the title and rename the file `[lastname1]_[lastname2]_primer_r.ipynb`, where the `lastname` fields are replaced by your and your lab partner's last names. So, for example, my file would be called `Wong_primer_r.ipynb` because nobody wants to be my lab partner.\n","\n","**e)** Finally, you are ready to get to work modifying and executing the codes in the Jupyter notebook!

You don't want to need to keep track of all kinds of auxiliary files for images to embed because that would be very annoying.\n","\n","Instead, we can be slick!\n","\n","We can include images via an internet URL by replacing the local file path in parentheses above with a URL. You can get image URLs by right-clicking on an image and clicking \"Copy image address\". If you have your images on a server somewhere, great. If not, have no fear, as with many aspects of life, Google Drive is here to help.\n","\n","You can get share links for items in your Google Drive in the usual way (right click, Get shareable link). If you go this route, be sure to change the settings so that *anyone* with the link can view, not just people at RIT.\n","\n","Now, simply replacing the URL or local file path with the Google share link will **not** work. Suppose that for an image I want to embed in this Jupyter notebook, the full share link as copied out of Google Drive is [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iy4EQQZy0jfhYlHDys1uQAS5wf2hXGmZ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iy4EQQZy0jfhYlHDys1uQAS5wf2hXGmZ/view?usp=sharing).\n","\n","I can include this image by taking the *file ID* of this file, prepending it with `https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=`, and inserting *that* string within the parentheses for the image file. The file ID is the string of characters between the forward slashes after the `/d/` in the share link.  So, the file ID for my image is the string `1iy4EQQZy0jfhYlHDys1uQAS5wf2hXGmZ`.\n","\n","To include the image, I would use the syntax below.

There is.\n","\n","We can use HTML code within Jupyter notebooks in order to have more control over the formatting of both images and text. To adjust the image to have a width of 500 pixels, we can use the HTML `img` command as shown below. Note that the URL used is the same as with the Markdown `![]()` syntax.

You can view these waypoints and changes by clicking `File` > `Revision history`. \n","* Note, however, that the frequency with which Google auto-saves the notebook might not match how often _you_ want to save your work (say, after you complete a tough section). Also, it is always good to manually save every once in a while to make sure (1) you're still connected to your Google Drive and (2) you're still connected to the internet. It doesn't happen often, but if it does and you lose a bunch of work, that's a very frustrating experience."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Amz7R2_TgLcx","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 8 So what do I do with these coding labs?\n","\n","Now there's a good question!\n","\n","These labs are meant to introduce how the concepts we learn in the classroom play out in real-world coding and data-driven applications.
