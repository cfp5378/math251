The beauty of Jupyter Notebooks, however, is that it allows you to combine **computer code**, **mathematical equations in LaTeX**, and regular prose (words) in **Markdown** all in one interactive document. Colab notebooks are great because it provides the benefits of Jupyter notebooks without requiring students to install software on their own computers; rather, all of the code you run will be done in the Google Cloud. This means we don't have to worry about pesky installation issues, and everyone is on a level playing field. The same code will, in theory, run at the same speed whether you execute it from your phone or from a supercomputer. \n","\n","Jupyter notebooks in Python have the largest market share, but you can also run them using the R or Julia coding languages. For our class, we will use Jupyter notebooks in R. All three languages are in widespread use in Applied Statistics and Data Science. Note that R Jupyter notebooks aren't *officially* supported by Google Colab, but we can make them work. \n","\n","One big reason that Jupyter notebooks are used so widely in applied sciences is that they make it easy to develop mathematical models and software implementing these models, and *include explanations and derivations right in the same file*. This, along with the fact that you can export the notebook to a PDF (or other document formats), facilitates the sharing of research work. Being able to do this remotely is important (especially in the current pandemic situation), and being able to work with a lab partner (or *Colab* partner, if you will?! You won't? That's okay, I laughed) is just plain nice. It would be annoying to have to send codes to one another iteratively to work on something... and so enter Colab Jupyter notebooks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5DcDLCzGcjTN","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<br>\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1  Accessing and opening the Jupyter Notebook file\n","\n","**a)** To access Colab notebooks, go to https://colab.research.google.com/. \n","\n","**b)** From there, we can access the Jupyter notebook that I created this PDF tutorial from by pasting in the Github link. If you are unfamiliar with Github, just think of it as a big archive of different repositories of software. Each user can have their own set of repositories, and each repository is typically dedicated to a particular purpose. I set up a repository to house the Jupyter notebooks for this class. It's a great purpose.\n","\n","In the upper-left of your screen, you should see the `File` menu. Click it, and then click `Open notebook`.\n","\n","Click on the `Github` option on the horizontal menu along the top of the page that opens.\n","\n","Paste the Github URL for the `primer_r.ipynb` file on the search line next to the magnifying glass.

The URL is:\n","> https://github.com/tonyewong/math251/blob/master/primer_r.ipynb\n","\n","This will be different for each notebook. You can also preview the notebook in Github by clicking on the link above. There, the notebook will also include a button to `Open in Colab`.\n","\n","After you paste in the URL, press `Enter` or click on the magnifying glass search button. This should open a familiar-looking Jupyter notebook!\n","\n","**c)** While that was no doubt extremely exciting, you aren't quite there yet. If you aren't signed into a Google account, later, Colab will give you an error  message saying `Google sign-in required`. We can nip this in the bud by signing in first. In the upper-right, there should either be an icon showing your Google profile picture (or initials), or a blue button that says `Sign in`.\n","* If it shows your Google profile picture (initials), then that's the Google Drive account that _*your*_ version of this Jupyter notebook will be saved under.\n","* If the `Sign in` button is showing, then sign into your preferred Google Drive account (say, your RIT Google Drive?) by clicking the button and entering your RIT credentials. Keep in mind that the email address with be your RIT email address, followed by `@g.rit.edu` (note the \"g.\").\n","\n","**d)** Once you are signed in, try to save the notebook by either pressing `Ctrl+S` (or `Command+S` on a Mac) or clicking `File` > `Save`. You should get an error message that says \"Cannot save changes. You do not have permission to save this notebook. To keep your changes, make a copy of the notebook.\" This message is telling you that I, the author of the notebook, don't want you messing around with my notebook! Fair enough. So, you need to click `Save a copy in Drive`. This will save a copy of the notebook in _your own_ Google Drive. Go ahead and click that now. Alternatively, you could have clicked `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` straightaway without that `Ctrl+S` nonsense.\n","\n","This will open a new window with a file entitled `Copy of primer_r.ipynb`. You can see this title at the top of your screen. This is _your version_ of the file, saved in *your* Google Drive as opposed to my Google Drive (where I made the file) or my Github repository (where I shared the file with you). Thus, we call your new version of the file your *local* version (since it is local to you). But, I'm sorry to say, the file's title sucks. Let's fix that. Click anywhere on the title and rename the file `[lastname1]_[lastname2]_primer_r.ipynb`, where the `lastname` fields are replaced by your and your lab partner's last names. So, for example, my file would be called `Wong_primer_r.ipynb` because nobody wants to be my lab partner.\n","\n","**e)** Finally, you are ready to get to work modifying and executing the codes in the Jupyter notebook! First, a helpful tidbit:\n","\n","To figure out _where_ in your Google Drive the file is located, click on `File` > `Locate in Drive`. This will open a window that highlights the Google Drive folder that is housing your notebook. Most often, new notebooks will be in a folder entitled `Colab Notebooks`. Feel free to create another Google Drive folder to put your lab notebooks in. How you organize your Google Drive is up to you, but I **strongly** encourage you to **back up your work** for this and all of your classes in Google Drive (or Github, or anywhere).
